# RavingTwitchAlerts
A minimal alert system for getting EventSub alerts from Twitch and showing as an OBS overlay

This uses SimConnect to connect to MSFS2020 for flight information.
You will need to expose the alert_overlay to Twitch from your localhost. I use [PageKite](https://pagekite.net/) to do that.
